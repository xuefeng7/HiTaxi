## High Taxi Demanding Prediction in NYC by Time, Region, Facility, Event and Weather.
#### A University of Rochester VISTA Lab project dedicated to ubran computing research

Heavy traffic, untampered energy waste, deteriorating public safety, illegal drug dealings, and etc., all of those issues are ineluctable for a growing city. With more and more concerns towards those issues, people are determined to seek solutions that are able to not only ease them but also eradicate them. This determination finally leads people to urban computing --- a solution empowered by massive computing capabilities. This new way is not limited to solely solve those common issues a developing city may encounter, it aims to plan the city to be more intelligent in various aspects. Many researches are conducted with the goal of making cities smarter, some of them endeavor to improve the city traffic by proposing a large-scale taxi/bike ridesharing service, some of them endeavor to monitor and predict the air/water quality of certain city regions, and some of them are interested in energy consumption control via supervising urbane refueling behaviors. Those researches show numerous promising potentialities of urbane computing.

With the same goal of creating smarter cities, we are particularly interested in the traffic aspect.  Many city dwellers would complain that sometimes in certain areas of the city, it is extremely hard to catch a taxi or it takes too long to wait a bus/subway to come. On the other hand, taxi drivers are complaining that sometimes they are not aware of which part of the city is demanding the rides so as to lose their potential revenues. Imaging what if we can predict which region of a city would encounter an increasing demand of taxi or transportation in advance, then we can solve the complains from both sides by allocating the taxi drivers or schedule more public rides to those areas beforehand.

In this project, We aim not only to suggest taxi drivers with high taxi demanding regions in real-time, but also to uncover some insightful taxi demanding patterns given NYC's extraordinarily high density.
